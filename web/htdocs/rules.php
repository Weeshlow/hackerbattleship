<h4>Rules</h4>
<hr />
<p> <ul class="rules">
  <li><a href="/?mth=reg">Register</a> for the competition (teams of 1 are permitted)</li>
    <li>“The House” has a 7×7 <a href="/">battleship grid</a> laid out</li>
    <li>Each coordinate on the grid is tied to a hacking challenge of some kind.</li>
    <li>All of the teams work to sink all of The House’s ships.</li>
    <li>When a challenge is solved, the corresponding coordinate is revealed as either a hit or a miss. Additionally, the challenge closes, making it unavailable for other teams to solve.</li>
</ul> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Scoring</h4>
<hr />
<p> Points are awarded thus:
    <table class="rules">
        <tr><td>solving a challenge</td><td>points awarded based on individual challenge worth</td></tr>
        <tr><td>hitting a ship</td><td>5 points</td></tr>
        <tr><td>sinking a ship</td><td>10 points</td></tr>
    </table></li>
    <br />
</p>
<p> Note that in addition to the grid challenges, there are bonus challenges available.
   These are worth 10 points each. Unlike the grid challenges, the bonus challenges do 
   not close down once solved (though each team can solve them only once).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Winning</h4>
<hr />
<p>At the end of the competition, the team with the most points wins the game.</p>
